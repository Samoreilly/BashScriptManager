Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project directory

Before building or publishing, change to your project folder (where the .csproj file is located):

cd /path/to/your/app/ConsoleApp2

2. Build and Publish

Publish a self-contained Linux executable:

dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained=true -o ./publish

This command:

    Builds your project in Release mode

    Targets Linux x64 platform

    Produces a self-contained executable (no separate runtime needed)

    Outputs the result into the publish folder inside your project directory

Make sure your images folder is included in the publish output. You can configure your .csproj to copy it automatically or copy it manually after publishing.
3. Run the Application

Run the app from inside the project directory (parent of publish):

./publish/ConsoleApp2

    Important: Running the executable from outside the project directory may cause resource loading errors (e.g., missing images).

Troubleshooting

    If you get errors about missing image files, check that the images folder exists inside publish.

    The app uses paths relative to its executable location for resources.

    To ensure consistent behavior, the app sets its working directory to the executable location on startup.

    Watch out for GTK warnings about adding widgets multiple times â€” each widget should be added to only one container.
